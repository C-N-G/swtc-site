## Ability
On your first night, you learn a Loyalist [[player]] (not yourself). If they are alive, you are alive. If they are dead, you are dead. This ability works even if you are dead.

## Examples
- John is on the Loyalist team. The Tethered wakes up on their first night, and learns that John is a Loyalist. John dies later in the game, so the Tethered dies as well. John is later resurrected, so the Tethered is resurrected as well.
- John is on the Loyalist team. The Tethered wakes up on their first night, and learns that John is a Loyalist. The Tethered is chosen to be killed by the Traitor, but does not die because John is still alive.
- John is on the Loyalist team. The Tethered wakes up on their first night, and learns that John is a Loyalist. The Tethered is dismissed but does not die because John is still alive.
- The Tethered is only malfunctioning on their first night. Jane is on the Subversive team. The Tethered wakes up on their first night, and incorrectly learns that Jane is a Loyalist. Jane dies later in the game, the Tethered does not die because their ability was malfunctioning. If the Tethered stops malfunctioning after their first night they do not gain new information.
- The Tethered is malfunctioning. John is on the Loyalist team. The Tethered wakes up on their first night, and learns that John is a Loyalist. John dies later in the game, but the Tethered does not die because they are malfunctioning. If the Tethered stops malfunctioning whilst John is still dead, the Tethered will die as well.

## How to Play
- As long as the Loyalist player you learnt is still alive, and you're not malfunctioning, you're unable to die. This is a very powerful ability! If you pretend to be another role, you might be able to get a Subversive player to target you and try to kill you, thus wasting their ability.
- Your ability is one of the few abilities in the game that offers nearly failsafe confirmation of your role. If the player you learnt dies, and you die as well, there are very few ways that could've happened without you being the Tethered. One strategy might be to intentionally get the player you learnt killed, to confirm both you and them as Loyalist players.

## How to Narrate
- The first night that the Tethered is in play, wake up the Tethered. Tell them a Loyalist player. Send them back to sleep. If the player they learnt dies, then kill the Tethered. If the player they learnt is resurrected, then resurrect the Tethered.
