- Keep in mind that questions are not always binary yes or no questions, you could be asked any question the Narrator deems fit to ask. Using the principles of logic you can infer certain information about the game from whether your answer to a question was correct or not.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Postcog. Ask them a question of your choosing. Tell them if their answer was correct or not. Send them back to sleep.
