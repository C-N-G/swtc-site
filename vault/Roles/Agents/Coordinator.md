## Ability
You start knowing that 1 of 3 [[Player|players]] is a specific [[Detrimental]] [[role]] or that 0 are in-play.

## Examples
- The Coordinator wakes up on the first night, and learns that John, Jane, or Adam is the [[Underachiever]]. Adam is the [[Underachiever]].
- The Coordinator wakes up on the first night, and learns that there are 0 [[Detrimental|Detrimentals]] in play.
- The Coordinator wakes up on the first night. There is 1 [[Detrimental]] in play, but they are the [[Prisoner]]. The Coordinator incorrectly learns that there are 0 [[Detrimental|Detrimentals]] in play.
- The Coordinator is [[Malfunctioning]]. The Coordinator wakes up on the first night, and incorrectly learns that John, Jane, or Eve is the [[Underachiever]].

## How to Play
- You should try to correlate your information with other [[player]]'s information to try and work out who is the [[Detrimental]] [[Role]] that you learnt.
- As a start knowing [[Role]], as soon as you've received your information your ability has been used. This makes you an ideal candidate for attempting strategies like swapping [[Role|roles]] with another [[player]] or bluffing to try and get the [[Subversive]] team to waste their abilities on you.

## How to Narrate
- The first night that the Coordinator is in play wake up the Coordinator. Tell them that 1 of 3 [[Player|players]] is a specific [[Detrimental]] [[Role]] or that there are 0 [[Detrimental]] [[Role|roles]] in this game. Send them back to sleep.
