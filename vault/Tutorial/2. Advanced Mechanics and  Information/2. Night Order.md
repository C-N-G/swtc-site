During the night there is a specific order in which roles and characteristics wake up to use their abilities, this order is determined by the type of ability they have. If a [[player]] can perform abilities from different positions in the order, then they must still perform both of their abilities in order and they must wait if any other [[Player|players]] act in between. Certain abilities activate passively, such as activating when another [[player]] acts and thus are omitted from the order.
