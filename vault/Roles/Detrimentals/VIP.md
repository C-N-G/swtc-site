## Ability
If you're dismissed your team loses.

## Examples
- There is 3 Cohesion left. The VIP is [[Dismissal|dismissed]], and dies. The Cohesion is immediately decreased by 3. The [[Subversive]] team win the game.
- The VIP is [[Malfunctioning]]. The VIP is [[Dismissal|dismissed]], and dies. The Cohesion is unchanged.

## How to Play
- Do not die! Don't let the [[Subversive]] team find out that you're the VIP, otherwise they might target you.
- If you're about to be [[Dismissal|dismissed]] and have no other defence, you might as well come out and tell everyone you're the VIP. It's better that the [[Antagonist]] has to spend a night killing you instead of your team doing it for them through a [[dismissal]].
- Try to become [[Malfunctioning]], this will allow you to die without decreasing the Cohesion.

## How to Narrate
- If the VIP dies, immediately decrease the Cohesion by 3.
