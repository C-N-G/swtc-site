## Ability
Each night, after the first, you learn the team of a [[player]] who voted to dismiss you during the previous day.

## Examples
- John is on the Loyalist team. John is the only player who voted to dismiss the Reflective player during the previous day. The Reflective player learns that a Loyalist player voted to dismiss them.
- The Reflective player is malfunctioning. John is on the Loyalist team. John is the only player who voted to dismiss the Reflective player during the previous day. The Reflective player learns that a Subversive player voted to dismiss them.

## How to Play
- If only a small number of players vote to dismiss you, you stand a better chance of effectively using your information.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, after the first, if any player voted to dismiss the Reflective player during the previous, wake up the Reflective player. Tell them the team of a player who voted to dismiss them. Send them back to sleep.
