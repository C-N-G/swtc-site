## Ability
Once per game, if you are the target of an ability, another player is targeted instead.

## Examples
- John is the Bodyguard. John chooses the Cunning player during the night, but Jane is targeted instead.
- Jane is the Traitor. The Cunning Player has been targeted by an ability earlier in the game. Jane chooses the Cunning player during the night, the Cunning player dies.
- The Cunning player is malfunctioning. Jane is the Traitor. Jane chooses the Cunning player during the night, John is targeted instead and dies.

## How to Play
- As your ability is passive, it could save you from death or negative abilities without your direct involvement! However, it's also true that a player might waste a beneficial ability on you and end up targeting the wrong player. Try to tell players you trust that you're Cunning!

## How to Narrate
- The first time the Cunning player is the target of an ability, redirect the ability to another player instead.
