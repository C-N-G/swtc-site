## Ability
Each night, you must choose 3 players: you learn if at least one of them is on the Subversive team.

## Examples (OUT OF DATE)
- The Clairvoyant chooses John. John is the [[Traitor]]. The Clairvoyant learns that John is on the [[Subversive]] team.
- The Clairvoyant chooses Jane. Jane is the [[Prisoner]], and appears like they're on the [[Subversive]] team. The Clairvoyant incorrectly learns that Jane is on the [[Subversive]] team.
- The Clairvoyant is [[Malfunctioning]]. The Clairvoyant chooses John. John is the [[Traitor]]. The Clairvoyant incorrectly learns that John is on the [[Loyalist]] team.

## How to Play (OUT OF DATE)
- You have a very powerful ability, and should be wary of being too open about your [[Role]] with untrusted [[Player|players]]. If a [[Subversive]] [[player]] finds out that you are the Clairvoyant, they will probably want to kill you immediately. Try to remain hidden whilst sharing your information as much as possible. Every night that you can stay alive is another night where you can learn a [[player]] who most likely can be trusted!
- You can try to get [[Player|players]] you trust to intentionally claim your [[Role]], so that you can stay hidden for longer.

## How to Narrate (OUT OF DATE)
- Each night, wake up the Clairvoyant. Tell them to choose a [[player]]. Tell them the team of their chosen [[player]]. Send them back to sleep.
