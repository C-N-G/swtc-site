The person who has assumed the position of [[Narrator]] plays a very special part in Secrets Within the Compound. They control the setup of the game, determining who gets what [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]], and carry out the functions that allow the game to work, but the [[Narrator]] is not simply an automaton, instead the [[Narrator]] plays a part that is similar to the Game Master that is present in various tabletop [[role]]-playing games. Certain decisions, such as the setup of the game, or the length of the day phase, are all left to the discretion and enforcement of the [[Narrator]]. In essence, the [[Narrator]] is not simply a spectator of the game but an active participant in shaping the flow of the game, and thus the [[Narrator]] should attempt to make the game as interesting and fun for all participants whilst still maintaining a balanced game for both teams. However, it is important to remember that the [[Narrator]] is still bound by the rules of the game, and cannot under any circumstances simply do whatever they want arbitrarily.
