## Ability
You are [[Confusion|confused]] about being an [[Agent]]. If you are [[Obsession|obsessed]] that you are the Tulpa, you will be [[Dismissal|dismissed]] immediately.

## Examples
- The Tulpa is [[Confusion|confused]] about being the [[Analyst]]. The [[Subversive]] team are winning. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Tulpa up and interacts with them as if they were the [[Analyst]], and incorrectly tells them that the [[Loyalist]] team are winning.
- The Tulpa is [[Confusion|confused]] about being the [[Analyst]]. The [[Loyalist]] team are winning. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Tulpa up and interacts with them as if they were the [[Analyst]], and correctly tells them that the [[Loyalist]] team are winning.
- The Tulpa is [[Obsession|obsessed]] that they are the Tulpa. The Tulpa is [[Dismissal|dismissed]] immediately.
- The Tulpa is [[malfunctioning]]. Their [[confusion]] is not impacted, but they will no longer be [[Dismissal|dismissed]] if they are [[Obsession|obsessed]] about being the Tulpa. The Tulpa is [[Confusion|confused]] about being the [[Analyst]]. The [[Subversive]] team are winning. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Tulpa up and interacts with them as if they were the [[Analyst]], and incorrectly tells them that the [[Loyalist]] team are winning. During the day, the Tulpa is [[Obsession|obsessed]] that they are the Tulpa, they are not [[Dismissal|dismissed]].

## How to Play
- Always remember, just because you're [[Confusion|confused]] doesn't mean you will always receive false information. [[Confusion|Confused]] abilities receive arbitrary information at the discretion of the [[Narrator]]. However, in most cases you are likely to be given information that will benefit the [[Subversive]] team the most.
- Try to work out how much of your information is true or false to help determine whether you are the Tulpa, but be careful! If you're [[Obsession|obsessed]] about being the Tulpa, you will be [[Dismissal|dismissed]].
- If you believe you are the Tulpa, sometimes it may be worth intentionally being [[Obsession|obsessed]] as to be [[Dismissal|dismissed]] and prove your [[role]]. Be mindful however, as this will potentially waste a day for the [[Loyalist]] team.
- If you have a non-informational ability that clearly has no effect when you use it, such as an [[Exorcist]] choosing a known Spirit, then you are almost certainly the Tulpa or [[malfunctioning]].

## How to Narrate
- Choose a [[role]] that the Tulpa is [[Confusion|confused]] as. Do not tell them they are the Tulpa, tell them they are the [[role]] you chose. Treat the Tulpa as if they were [[role]] you chose, following the rules of [[confusion]]. If the Tulpa is [[Obsession|obsessed]] that they are the Tulpa, dismiss them immediately.
- You can provide the Tulpa with any arbitrary information that corresponds to the [[role]] they believe they have. However, be cautious about game balance; their ability should primarily be [[Detrimental]] to the [[Loyalist]] team.
