## Ability
Each night, after the first, you change team.

## Examples
- The Turncoat starts the game on the Loyalist team. The following night the Turncoat joins the Subversive team. The Turncoat dies whilst on the Subversive team and remains Subversive for the rest of the game.
- The Turncoat starts the game on the Subversive team. The following night the Turncoat joins the Loyalist team. The Turncoat dies whilst on the Loyalist team and remains Loyalist for the rest of the game.
- The Turncoat is malfunctioning. The Turncoat starts the game on the Loyalist team, and does not change team during the game because they are malfunctioning.
- The Turncoat is malfunctioning. The Turncoat starts the game on the Subversive team, and does not change team during the game because they are malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- As the Turncoat you're able to play for both teams, but if you want to win then you need to predict what day the game will end and what team you'll be on during that day.
- If you want to lock into one team, then try getting killed whilst you're on that team. Your ability will no longer work because you're dead, and you'll stay on that team.
- Try hedging your bets as to which team to primarily play for. If you play your cards right you might be able to swing the game in your desired direction at the last moment.

## How to Narrate
- Choose which team the Turncoat starts the game on. Every night, wake up the Turncoat and tell them they have changed team. Send them back to sleep.
