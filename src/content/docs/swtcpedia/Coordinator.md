## Ability

You start knowing that 1 of 3 players is a specific [Detrimental](/swtcpedia/detrimental) [Role](/swtcpedia/role) or that 0 are in-play.

## Examples

* The Coordinator wakes up on the first night, and learns that John, Jane, or Adam is the Underachiever. Adam is the Underachiever.
* The Coordinator wakes up on the first night, and learns that there are 0 [Detrimentals](/swtcpedia/detrimental) in play.
* The Coordinator wakes up on the first night. There is 1 [Detrimental](/swtcpedia/detrimental) in play, but they are the [Prisoner](/swtcpedia/prisoner). The Coordinator incorrectly learns that there are 0 [Detrimentals](/swtcpedia/detrimental) in play.
* The Coordinator is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). The Coordinator wakes up on the first night, and incorrectly learns that John, Jane, or Eve is the Underachiever.

## How to Play

* You should try to correlate your information with other player's information to try and work out who is the [Detrimental](/swtcpedia/detrimental) [Role](/swtcpedia/role) that you learnt.
* As a start knowing [Role](/swtcpedia/role), as soon as you've received your information your ability has been used. This makes you an ideal candidate for attempting strategies like swapping [roles](/swtcpedia/role) with another player or bluffing to try and get the [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team to waste their abilities on you.

## How to Narrate

* The first night that the Coordinator is in play wake up the Coordinator. Tell them that 1 of 3 players is a specific [Detrimental](/swtcpedia/detrimental) [Role](/swtcpedia/role) or that there are 0 [Detrimental](/swtcpedia/detrimental) [roles](/swtcpedia/role) in this game. Send them back to sleep.
