Secrets Within the Compound is set in a world where a secret international organization, the Human Preservation Agency, has been set up to help preserve human life on Earth against a myriad of threats, such as ghosts, vampires, demons, and so on; at least, that’s what the Human Preservation Agency tells itself.
The Human Preservation Agency maintains bases of operations around the world, known as compounds, this game takes place in one such compound… but this compound has a few problems. An unknown [[Subversive]] force has gained entry to the compound and walks amongst you. It’s the job of those loyal to the Human Preservation Agency to deduce what’s going on and deal with this [[Subversive]] element, before this problem gets out of hand, otherwise, it’s only a matter of time until the Agency’s operations collapse! To make matters even worse for the Agency, a wave of psychic energy has rippled through the compound, and the usual Agency safeguards have malfunctioned and now the ghosts of the deceased walk the corridors once again.
