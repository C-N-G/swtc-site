## Ability
On your first night, all [[Antagonist|Antagonists]] learn who you are.

## Setup
You are confused about being an Agent.

## Examples
- On the first night, all Antagonists learn who the Pawn is. The Pawn is [[Confusion|confused]] about being the [[Analyst]]. The Subversive team are winning. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Pawn up and interacts with them as if they were the Analyst, and incorrectly tells them that the Loyalist team are winning.
- On the first night, all Antagonists learn who the Pawn is. The Pawn is [[Confusion|confused]] about being the [[Analyst]]. The Loyalist team are winning. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Pawn up and interacts with them as if they were the Analyst, and tells them that the Loyalist team are winning.
- The Pawn is [[malfunctioning]], thus no Antagonists learn who the Pawn is, apart from this there is no difference to their ability. The Pawn is confused about being the Analyst. The Subversive team are winning. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Pawn up and interacts with them as if they were the Analyst, and incorrectly tells them that the Loyalist team are winning.

## How to Play
- Just because someone claims to be the [[Antagonist]] and tells you that you're the Pawn doesn't mean they're telling the truth!
- If you suspect that you're the Pawn, then your number one priority should be trying to confirm your [[Role]]. If the [[Role]] you think you are is consistently giving you information you know to be wrong, then perhaps you are the Pawn.

## How to Narrate
- You can provide the Pawn with any arbitrary information that corresponds to the [[Role]] they believe they have. However, be cautious about game balance; their ability should primarily be [[Detrimental]] to the [[Loyalist]] team.
