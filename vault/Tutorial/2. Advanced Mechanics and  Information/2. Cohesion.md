Cohesion is a measurement of how well the compound is functioning in accordance with the goals of the Human Preservation Agency.
Cohesion starts at 10 and decreases by 1 for every [[Loyalist]] [[Agent]] that dies, and increases by 1 for every [[Loyalist]] [[Agent]] that is resurrected.
Cohesion is hidden from most [[Player|players]], only [[Player|players]] with certain abilities can learn the current Cohesion.
If Cohesion reaches zero the [[Subversive]] team win the game.
