## Ability
Once per game, during the day, you may publicly choose a [[player]]: if they are a Spirit, they die.

## Examples
- John is the Vessel. The Exorcist publicly chooses John. John immediately dies.
- Jane is the Analyst. The Exorcist publicly chooses Jane. Nothing happens, as Jane is not a Spirit.
- The Exorcist is malfunctioning. John is the Vessel. The Exorcist publicly chooses John. Nothing happens, because the Exorcist is malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- You have a potentially very powerful ability that could win your team the game at any time, if the Antagonist is a Spirit! The longer you wait to use your ability the more likely you are to choose a relevant player, but the longer you wait the more likely you are to die before you get to use your ability! You need to weigh up carefully when you think is the best day to use your ability.
- As you have a potentially very powerful ability, you should keep your role a secret. Consider bluffing as a role that is likely to be left alive, or try swapping your role with another player you trust!

## How to Narrate
- Once per game, during the day, if the Exorcist publicly chooses a Spirit, mark that player as dead. Continue the day.
