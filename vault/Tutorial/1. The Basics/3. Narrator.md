The person who has assumed the [[Role]] of [[narrator]] plays a very special [[Role]] in Secrets Within the Compound. They control the setup of the game, determining who gets what [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]], and carry out the functions that allow the game to work, but the [[narrator]] is not simply an automaton, instead the [[narrator]] fills a [[Role]] a bit like a Game Master present in various tabletop [[Role]]-playing games. Certain decisions, such as how certain abilities work, or calling the game to an end early, are all left to the discretion and enforcement of the [[narrator]]. In essence, the [[narrator]] is not simply a spectator of the game but an active participant in shaping the flow of the game, and thus the [[narrator]] should attempt to make the game as interesting and fun for all participants whilst still maintaining a balanced game for both teams. However, it is important to remember the [[narrator]] is still bound by the rules of the game, and cannot under any circumstances simply do whatever they want arbitrarily.
