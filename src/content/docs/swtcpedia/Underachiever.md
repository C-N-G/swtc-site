## Ability

You do not know you are the Underachiever. You think you are an [Agent](/swtcpedia/agent) [Role](/swtcpedia/role), but you are not.

## Examples

* The Underachiever thinks they are the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst). The Narrator wakes the Underachiever up and treats them as if they are the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst) who is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).
* The Underachiever is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). There is no difference to their ability. The Underachiever thinks they are the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst). The Narrator wakes the Underachiever up and treats them as if they are the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst) who is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## How to Play

* If you suspect that you're the Underachiever, then your number one priority should be trying to confirm your [Role](/swtcpedia/role). If the [Role](/swtcpedia/role) you think you are is consistently giving you information you know to be wrong, then perhaps you are the [Accomplice](/swtcpedia/accomplice).

## How to Narrate

* Treat the Underachiever as if they were the [Role](/swtcpedia/role) that they believe themselves to be and as if that [Role](/swtcpedia/role) was [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).
* You can provide the Underachiever with any arbitrary information that corresponds to the [Role](/swtcpedia/role) they believe they have. However, be cautious about game balance; their ability should primarily be [detrimental](/swtcpedia/detrimental) to the [Loyalist](/swtcpedia/loyalist) team.
