Modules are collections of [roles](/swtcpedia/role) and [characteristics](/swtcpedia/characteristic) that are either thematically or mechanically similar, or just play well together. In Secrets Within the Compound [roles](/swtcpedia/role) and [characteristics](/swtcpedia/characteristic) from any module can be mixed and matched, but if youâ€™re wanting a simpler game in scope, then try playing with just the basic module: [Standard Procedure](/swtcpedia/standard-procedure).
