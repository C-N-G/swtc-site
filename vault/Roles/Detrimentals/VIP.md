## Ability
If you're dismissed your team loses.

## Examples
- The VIP is dismissed. The VIP is on the Loyalist team so the Loyalist team loses.
- The VIP is dismissed. The VIP is on the Subversive team so the Subversive team loses.
- The VIP is malfunctioning. The VIP is dismissed. Nothing happens because the VIP was malfunctioning when they were dismissed.

## How to Play
- If you're ever about to be dismissed, claim to be the VIP as much as possible. It might be the only way to save yourself from being dismissed.
- The VIP is a great role for Antagonists to pretend to be to avoid being dismissed. If you're too open about being the VIP then players might suspect you're actually an Antagonist.
- Try to get yourself killed. You could pretend to be a powerful Agent role in the hope that an Antagonist kills you during the night. If you're dead, then your ability can't trigger, and you've helped your team.
- Be aware that just because you might survive a dismissal doesn't mean your ability won't trigger. If you're dismissed, even if you survive somehow, your team will lose.

## How to Narrate
- If the VIP is dismissed, even if they survive, end the game. The VIP's team loses.
