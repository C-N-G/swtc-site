## Ability
On your first night, you learn 3 not in-play [[Role|roles]]. Each night, after the first, you must choose a [[player]]: that [[player]] dies.

## Examples
- The [[Narrator]] wakes the Traitor up on the first night, and tells them 3 not in-play [[Role|roles]]. Each night, after the first night, the [[Narrator]] wakes the Traitor up to choose a [[player]] to kill.
- The [[Narrator]] wakes the Traitor up during the night, and asks them to choose a [[player]]. That [[player]] dies. At the start of the following day, the [[Narrator]] announces who has died.
- The [[Narrator]] wakes the Traitor up during the night, and asks them to choose a [[player]]. The Traitor chooses an already dead [[player]], so their target does not die.
- It is the final day of the game. The Traitor is the last [[Subversive|Subversive]] [[player]] alive. The remaining [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] dismiss the Traitor, and the [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] win the game.
- The [[Narrator]] wakes the Traitor up during the night, and asks them to choose a [[player]]. The Traitor is [[Malfunctioning]], so their target does not die.

## How to Play
- You should attempt to bluff as 1 of the 3 not in-play [[Role|roles]] you learnt at the start of the game, this means you won't accidentally claim someone else's [[Role]].
- Like all [[Subversive]] [[Player|players]] being able to bluff and fit in with the group is key to winning the game. Try everything and anything to fit in, be careful though, if you're too active [[Player|players]] might begin to suspect you. Sometimes being silent can work just as well.
- You can only kill one [[player]] at night, so make it count! Try to work out the [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]] of other [[Player|players]] so you can target the [[Player|players]] who are most valuable to their team.
- If you want to frame someone who has just died as an [[Antagonist]] you could choose already dead [[Player|players]] with your ability so that nobody new dies.

## How to Narrate
- The first night that the Traitor is in play wake up the Traitor. Tell them 3 [[Role|roles]] that are not in-play. Send them back to sleep.
- Each night, after the first, wake up the Traitor. Ask them to choose a [[player]]. Send them back to sleep. Mark their choice as dead. At the start of the following day, announce which [[player]] died at night.
