## Ability
On your first day, your characteristic is announced to all players.

## Examples
- The Narrator announces to all players who is Forthright on the first day that they are in play.
- The Forthright player is malfunctioning. The Narrator does not make an announcement, even if later the Forthright player stops malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- Whilst it might seem simple, your ability can severely narrow the field for you and other players to deduce the state of the game. You are infallibly proven to be Forthright by the Narrator's announcement. Your characteristic could be the linchpin to stringing together other evidence.

## How to Narrate
- On the first day that the Forthright characteristic is in play, announce at the start of that day who is Forthright.
