The second important thing a [[Narrator]] needs to master is Authority! Authority doesn’t mean being rude, yelling, shouting, or being demeaning. Authority means that all the [[Player|players]] are actually following your instructions; remember, you have the final say in all rulings.
Mastering Authority means mastering the flow of the game. Here are some helpful pointers:

- Try to keep the day phases long enough to allow most [[Player|players]] to get out most of their information, but short enough that they can’t get out all of their information or talk to all other [[Player|players]]. 4-6 Minutes per day, before opening nominations, is usually good, but ultimately it depends on the [[player]] count and the current state of the game. Use your best judgement.
- Try to stop [[Player|players]] from interrupting each other. If someone is trying to speak but is being interrupted, make sure that [[player]] is given a chance to speak. This is especially important during nominations when discussion can easily get out of hand. You should allow the nominator an accusation, and then allow the nominee to defend themselves.
- Is there some game mechanic you don’t understand? Perhaps the documentation just isn’t clear? That’s okay! Just make sure all [[Player|players]] understand that whatever your interpretation of it, is how the game is to be currently played.
