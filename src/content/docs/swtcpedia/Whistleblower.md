## Ability

Each night, you learn the current Cohesion and decrease it by 1. You win with the [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team if the Cohesion reaches 0.

## Examples

* The Whistleblower wakes up and learns that the Cohesion is 1. The Whistleblower decreases the Cohesion by 1. The Cohesion reaches 0. The Whistleblower and the [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team win the game.
* The Whistleblower is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). The Whistleblower wakes up and incorrectly learns that the Cohesion is 2. The Whistleblower does not decrease the Cohesion. A [Loyalist](/swtcpedia/loyalist) [Agent](/swtcpedia/agent) dies that night. The Cohesion reaches 0, but the Whistleblower does not win.

## How to Play

* You're on the [Loyalist](/swtcpedia/loyalist) team, but you share a win condition with the [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team. You could win with either team, in the right circumstances. Try to play both sides to your advantage.
* Find the [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist), and try to convince them that you're the Whistleblower. If you gain their trust, then not only are they likely to leave you alive to help them, but you could turn on them at any moment to win with the [Loyalist](/swtcpedia/loyalist) team instead.

## How to Narrate

* Each night, wake up the Whistleblower. Tell them the current Cohesion. Decrease the Cohesion by 1. Send them back to sleep.
