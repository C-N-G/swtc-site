## Ability
Once per game, if your team would for any reason lose, it doesn't for one more day, even if you're dead.

## Examples
- John is the Bogeyman. John chose the Optimistic player during the night. The Optimistic player is dismissed during the day, thus normally winning the game for John, but because of the Optimistic ability the game continues for one more day.
- The Optimistic player is malfunctioning. John is the Bogeyman. John chose the Optimistic player during the night. The Optimistic player is dismissed during the day, thus winning the game for John.

## How to Play
- If your team can seize on the confusion of another day when your opponents think they should have won, you might be able to clutch a victory.
- Have hope.

## How to Narrate
- If the Optimistic player's team would lose the game, run the game for an additional day.
