If a [[player]] is injured then any abilities they have will no longer work, and they effectively have no abilities, unless otherwise specified.
If a [[player]] becomes injured during the day, it will be immediately announced publicly by the [[narrator]]. If a [[player]] becomes injured during the night, it will be announced publicly by the [[narrator]] at the start of the next day.
If a [[player]]’s [[injury]] is healed, then it will be announced publicly by the [[narrator]] at the first relevant opportunity.
If an injured [[player]]’s ‘once per game’ ability would be used up for any reason then it is not used up, and they will be able to use it when they are no longer injured.
