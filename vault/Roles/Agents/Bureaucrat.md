## Ability
Each night, after the first, you learn the team of a player that nominated during the day, you do not learn which player.

## Examples
- John is on the Loyalist team. John nominated someone during the day. The Bureaucrat wakes up and learns that 1 of the players that nominated someone was on the Loyalist team.
- John, Jane, and Adam, are on the Loyalist team. Eve is on the Subversive team. John, Jane, Adam, and Eve all nominated someone during the day. The Bureaucrat wakes up and learns that 1 of the players that nominated someone was on the Subversive team.
- The Bureaucrat is malfunctioning. John is on the Loyalist team. John nominated someone during the day. The Bureaucrat wakes up that night and incorrectly learns that 1 of the players that nominated someone was on the Subversive team.

## How to Play
 - If you can get only a small number of players to nominate each day, your information will be more useful, as there will be fewer people for you to learn information about.
 - You should try to get players that you're suspicious of to nominate! If you can learn what team they're on, you could potentially clear your suspicion.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, after the first, if a player nominated during the day, then wake up the Bureaucrat. Tell the Bureaucrat the team of a player that nominated during the day, do not tell them which player. Send them back to sleep.
- If a player changed team after they nominated, then for the purpose of the Bureaucrat's ability, count them as the team they were at the time of them nominating.
