## Ability
When you die, 2 [[Player|players]] on your team (not yourself) become [[malfunctioning]].

## Examples
- The Technician is [[Dismissal|dismissed]] and dies. 2 [[Player|players]] on their team (not them) immediately become [[Malfunctioning]].
- The Technician is [[Malfunctioning]]. The Technician dies during the night. Nobody becomes [[Malfunctioning]].

## How to Play
- Do not die! Don't let the [[Subversive]] team find out that you're the Technician, otherwise they might target you.
- If you're about to be [[Dismissal|dismissed]] and have no other defence, you might as well come out and tell everyone you're the Technician. It's better that the [[Antagonist]] has to spend a night killing you instead of your team doing it for them through a [[dismissal]].
- Try to become [[Malfunctioning]], this will allow you to die without making other [[Player|players]] [[Malfunctioning]].

## How to Narrate
- If the Technician dies, immediately mark 2 [[Player|players]] on their team (not them) as [[Malfunctioning]].
