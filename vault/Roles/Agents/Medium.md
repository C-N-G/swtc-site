## Ability
Each night, after the first, if a player is dead, you must choose a player: if they are dead, you learn their role. If they are alive, you learn they are alive.

## Examples
- John is the Analyst, and is dead. The Medium wakes up and chooses John, and learns that John is the Analyst.
- The Medium is malfunctioning. John is the Analyst, and is dead. The Medium wakes up and chooses John, and incorrectly learns that John is the Traitor.

## How to Play
- Keep your role a secret! The longer you can stay alive the more roles you'll be able to learn, if you can make it to the final day you'll have a good chance at proving yourself by telling everyone what their roles are.
- If you want to check a player's role, try to get them killed! You'll be able to confirm what role they are. This is particularly relevant for roles that have once per game abilities, once they've used their ability try to get them dismissed.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, after the first, if a player is dead, wake up the Medium. Tell them to choose a player. If their choice is dead, tell the Medium their role. If their choice is alive, tell the Medium they're alive. Send the Medium back to sleep.
- If no player is dead, do not wake up the Medium.
