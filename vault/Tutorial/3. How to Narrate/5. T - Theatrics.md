The 4th and last thing that a [[Narrator]] needs is theatrics. Theatrics is the least important part of the KART system, but is still a fundamental part of what it means to be a good [[Narrator]]. Theatrics is adding a slight bit of tension, acting, comedy, or even roleplaying to the game. You should attempt to get the [[Player|players]] immersed in both the game and the game’s theme.
Here are some things you can try:

- Use language that is consistent with the setting and theme of the game. Make sure the [[Player|players]] understand the theme even if they’re struggling to grasp the mechanics. They’re [[Agent|Agents]] and they have a job to do!
- Don’t immediately announce who has died or been [[Dismissal|dismissed]]. Build it up before you announce it. Attempt to subvert the expectations of your [[Player|players]], this will build tension and make [[Player|players]] excited for what you have to say.
