## Ability
Once per game, during the night, you may choose any not in-play [[characteristic]], you become that [[characteristic]]. If that [[characteristic]] is in-play, you become [[Confusion|confused]] about being that [[characteristic]].

## Examples
- The Alert characteristic is not in-play. The Adaptable player wakes up and chooses to become Alert. They become Alert.
- The Alert characteristic is in-play. The Adaptable player wakes up and chooses to become Alert. They become confused about being Alert because it was already in-play.
- The Adaptable player is malfunctioning. They will become confused about being any characteristic they choose, regardless of whether it is in play or not.

## How to Play
- Try to find out what characteristics are in-play before you choose!
- When you decide to use your ability, try to pick a characteristic that will synergise with your role.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Adaptable player. Ask them if they want to choose a characteristic. If they choose a characteristic, turn them into that characteristic, unless their choice is already in-play, in which case make them confused about being their choice. Send them back to sleep. If they decide not to choose, send them back to sleep and wake them up every night until they use their ability.
