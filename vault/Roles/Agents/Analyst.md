## Ability
Each night, you learn which team the [[Narrator]] thinks is winning.

## Examples
- The [[Subversive]] team is winning. Only one more night and they will almost certainly win the game. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Analyst and tells them that the [[Subversive]] team is winning.
- It is night one. The [[Subversive]] team have not had any significant impact on the game. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Analyst and tells them that the [[Loyalist]] team is winning.
- The Analyst is [[Malfunctioning]]. It is the final night of the game. The [[Subversive]] team is winning and most [[Player|players]] alive are clueless as to who the [[Antagonist]] is. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Analyst and tells them that the [[Loyalist]] team is winning.

## How to Play
- Your [[Role]] is fundamentally tied to the [[Narrator]]'s opinion of the state of the game. The more you know about the [[Narrator]] and what they might think in certain situations, the more likely you are to be able to effectively use your ability.
- You should try to take note of anything that can change in the game, you might be able to link these changes to what the [[Narrator]] tells you. Try to think about how certain [[Player|players]] dying might impact the balance of the game, and why that might cause the [[Narrator]] to give you a different team. This information could be vital in corroborating other [[Player|players]].

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Analyst. Tell them which team you think is winning. Send them back to sleep. Use your best judgement to ascertain the current state of the game.
