## Ability
Your neighbours cannot [[Malfunctioning|malfunction]].

## Examples
- One of the Cook's neighbours chooses a [[player]] with the [[Obnoxious]] [[Characteristic]], they do not become [[Malfunctioning]] because they neighbour the Cook.
- The Cook is [[Malfunctioning]]. One of the Cook's neighbours chooses a [[player]] with the [[Obnoxious]] [[Characteristic]], they become [[Malfunctioning]].

## How to Play
- Your ability is simple, but can be very useful for validating the information gained by your neighbours. Try to avoid ways in which you could become [[Malfunctioning]], so as to always be of benefit to your neighbours.
- If you believe your neighbours aren't on your team, then it might be a good idea to get yourself [[Dismissal|dismissed]] so that you're no longer protecting your opponents.

## How to Narrate
- The first night that the Cook is in play mark their neighbours as immune to [[Malfunctioning]].
- If the Cook becomes [[Malfunctioning]] remove the immunity from their neighbours.
