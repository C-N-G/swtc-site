## Ability
On your first night, you learn which of your neighbours are Antagonists, and they learn your role.

## Setup Effects
You neighbour an [[Antagonist]].

## Examples
- John is the Traitor. The Accomplice starts neighbouring John. The Accomplice learns that John is the Antagonist, and John learns who the Accomplice is.

## How to Play
- Be careful that you are not found out to be the Accomplice! If the Loyalist team know you're the Accomplice then they know that at least one of your neighbours is an Antagonist!

## How to Narrate
- Ensure that the Accomplice starts neighbouring an [[Antagonist]].
- On the first night that the Accomplice is in play, wake them up. Tell the Accomplice which of their neighbours are Antagonists. Send them back to sleep. Tell any Antagonist neighbours of the Accomplice who the Antagonist is.
