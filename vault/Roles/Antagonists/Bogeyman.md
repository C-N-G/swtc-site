## Ability
Each night, you must choose a [[player]] (not yourself): if they are [[Dismissal|dismissed]] you win. If no-one was [[Dismissal|dismissed]] during the day, the [[player]] that you chose dies that night.

## Examples
- The Bogeyman wakes up on the first night, and chooses John. During the first day, no-one is dismissed, John dies that night.
- The Bogeyman wakes up on the first night, and chooses John. During the first day, John is dismissed, the Bogeyman wins.
- The Bogeyman is malfunctioning. The Bogeyman wakes up on the first night, and chooses John. During the first day, John is dismissed, the game continues as normal because the Bogeyman is malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- The Loyalist team have a dilemma with you in the game, they must dismiss you to win, but every time they dismiss a player they run the risk of dismissing the player you chose and losing the game. Keeping this in mind, if you believe a player will be dismissed, you should choose them. However, be careful, because if no-one is dismissed you might end up eliminating every other suspicious player from the game besides you.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Bogeyman, ask them to choose a player, not themselves. Send them back to sleep. If the player they chose is dismissed, end the game and declare they have won. If no-one was dismissed, the player that they chose dies when they have to choose again.
