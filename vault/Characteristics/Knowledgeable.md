## Ability
On your first night, you learn whether a [[role]] of your choice is in play or not.

## Examples
- John is the Analyst. On the first night, the Knowledgeable player chooses to learn whether the Analyst is in play, and correctly learns that they are.
- The Knowledgeable player is malfunctioning. John is the Analyst. On the first night, the Knowledgeable player chooses to learn whether the Analyst is in play, and incorrectly learns that they are not.

## How to Play
-  A good strategy is to use your ability to determine what opposition you might face. If you are a Loyalist in a scenario with multiple Antagonists you could ask if one of them is in play. If you are a Subversive you could ask if a powerful Loyalist role is in play.

## How to Narrate
- On the first night that the Knowledgeable characteristic is in play, wake up the Knowledgeable player. Ask them to choose a role. Tell them if the role of their choice is in play or not. Send them back to sleep.
