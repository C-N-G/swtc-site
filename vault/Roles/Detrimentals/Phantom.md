## Ability
Any Loyalist ability that targets you has no effect and yields arbitrary information.

## Examples
- John is the Clairvoyant. John chooses Jane, Adam, and the Phantom, they are all the Loyalist team. John incorrectly learns that one of them is on the Subversive team because the Phantom was one of the players they chose.
- Jane is the Bodyguard. Jane chooses to protect the Phantom. The Phantom is not protected.

## How to Play
- The Phantom is an easy bluff for Subversive players, so be careful about telling other players you're the Phantom, as they're unlikely to believe you.
- You could try pretending to be a powerful Agent role to get the attention of the Subversive team. You might be able to get them to waste their abilities on you.

## How to Narrate
- If the Phantom is targeted by a Loyalist ability, give the relevant player(s) arbitrary information. If the ability would have a non-informational effect, make sure there is no effect.
