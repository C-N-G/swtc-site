## Ability
Each night, after the first, you might die.

## Examples
- John is the Traitor. John kills Jane during the night. The Test Subject dies from their own ability. The Test Subject and Jane are both dead.
- The Test Subject never dies from their own ability during the game, because the Narrator decided not to kill them.
- The Test Subject is malfunctioning. The Test Subject never dies from their own ability during the game.

## How to Play
- Any night, after the first, the Narrator could decide for you to die! Try not to provoke a situation in which you dying would be beneficial for the Subversive team, as the Narrator is likely to kill you if such a situation arises.
- It could be a good idea to get yourself dismissed as soon as possible, however, the Loyalist team is wasting a day killing you when you might die during the night anyway.
- While it could seem good to get yourself dismissed as soon as possible, an alternative strategy could be pretending to be a powerful Agent role in an attempt to get the Subversive team to target you during the night.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, after the first, decide if you want the Test Subject to die. If the Test Subject dies during the night, then treat them the same as any other dead player. Announce their death the following day.
