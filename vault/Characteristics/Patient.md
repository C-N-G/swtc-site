## Ability
Each day that you don't vote, your [[vote power]] increases by +1. If you vote, you lose this ability.

## Examples
- The Patient player does not vote during the first day. On the second day, their vote power is 2, and they vote. They lose their ability and their bonus voting power.
- The Patient player is malfunctioning. Their vote power does not change if they do not vote.

## How to Play
- The longer you wait to vote, the stronger your first vote will be. If you can survive long enough, you might be able to dismiss a player of your choice despite the voting pattern of other players.

## How to Narrate
- Each day that the Patient player does not vote, increase their vote power by +1. If they vote, remove their bonus vote power.
