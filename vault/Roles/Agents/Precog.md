## Ability
On your first night, you learn the answer to a single yes or no question of your choice.

## Examples
- The Precog's neighbours are on the Subversive team. The Precog wakes up on their first night, and asks: are any of my neighbours on the Subversive team? The Narrator tells them yes.
- John is the Analyst. The Precog wakes up on their first night, and asks: is John the Traitor? The Narrator tells them no.
- Jane is the Assistant. The Precog is malfunctioning. The Precog wakes up on their first night, and asks: is Jane the Traitor? The Narrator incorrectly tells them yes.

## How to Play
- Try to craft a question that will give you as much useful information as possible. If you ask a very broad and general question the information will usually be too generic to be helpful, but if you ask a very specific and narrow question the information could be too niche to be helpful.
- You have no significant need to hide your information, as once you've used your ability that is all the information you will receive. Tell as many people as you trust your information!

## How to Narrate
- The first night that the Precog is in play, wake up the Precog. Tell them to ask you a single yes or no question of their choice. Tell them the answer to their question. Send them back to sleep.
