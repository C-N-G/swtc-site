## Ability
Each night, after the first, you learn how many players who publicly said "What We Do, We Do For All" during the day are Loyalists.

## Examples
- John is on the Loyalist team. During the day, John publicly said "What We Do, We Do For All". The Oathkeeper wakes up that night, and learns that 1 player who said the phrase is a Loyalist.
- John is on the Loyalist team. Jane is on the subversive team. During the day, John and Jane publicly said "What We Do, We Do For All". The Oathkeeper wakes up that night, and learns that 1 player who said the phrase is a Loyalist.
- The Oathkeeper is malfunctioning. John is on the Loyalist team. Jane is on the subversive team. During the day, John and Jane publicly said "What We Do, We Do For All". The Oathkeeper wakes up that night, and learns that 2 players who said the phrase are Loyalists.

## How to Play
- Try to keep track of who said the phrase during the day. If you can't remember who said it, then whatever number you learn at night is significantly less useful to you.
- As long as players are aware that the Oathkeeper could potentially be in play, then they're likely to say the phrase whether you're open about being the Oathkeeper or not. If players are saying the phrase without your intervention, then just stay quiet and try to stay alive as long as possible to learn as much information.

## How to Narrate
- If any players publicly said the phrase during the day, then the following night wake up the Oathkeeper and tell them how many players who said the phrase are Loyalists. Send the Oathkeeper back to sleep.
