## Ability
You must vote yes on every nomination for dismissal.

## Examples
- John is nominated for dismissal. The Executioner must vote yes.
- The Executioner is malfunctioning. Jane is nominated for dismissal. The Executioner can vote however they would like, because they're malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- In some cases, the best course of action might be to get yourself killed as soon as possible. However, it's important to remember that, in most cases, the Loyalist team can only win through dismissals. Even if you are sometimes responsible for dismissing a Loyalist player, you still help narrow down the remaining pool of living players. The longer you survive, the more opportunities you have to bait the Subversive team into targeting you.

## How to Narrate
- Ensure that, unless they are malfunctioning, the Executioner votes yes on every nomination for dismissal.
