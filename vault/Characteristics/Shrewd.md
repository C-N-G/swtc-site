## Ability
Once per game, during the night, you may choose a player: you learn if the Narrator thinks that player's team is winning.

## Examples
- The Loyalist team is winning. John is on the Loyalist team. The Shrewd player asks if John's team is winning, and learns that the Narrator does believe John's team is winning.
- The Shrewd player is malfunctioning. The Loyalist team is winning. John is on the Loyalist team. The Shrewd player asks if John's team is winning, and incorrectly learns that the Narrator does not believe that John's team is winning.

## How to Play
- Contrasting the Narrator's answer with your knowledge of the state of the game can be used to infer the team of the player you chose.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Shrewd player. Ask them if they would like to choose a player. If they choose a player, tell them if you believe that their chosen player's team is winning. Send them back to sleep.
