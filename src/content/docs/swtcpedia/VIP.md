## Ability

When you die, the Cohesion decreases by 3.

## Examples

* There is 3 Cohesion left. The VIP is dismissed, and dies. The Cohesion is immediately decreased by 3. The [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team win the game.
* The VIP is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). The VIP is dismissed, and dies. The Cohesion is unchanged.

## How to Play

* Do not die! Don't let the [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team find out that you're the VIP, otherwise they might target you.
* If you're about to be dismissed and have no other defence, you might as well come out and tell everyone you're the VIP. It's better that the [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist) has to spend a night killing you instead of your team doing it for them through a dismissal.
* Try to become [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning), this will allow you to die without decreasing the Cohesion.

## How to Narrate

* If the VIP dies, immediately decrease the Cohesion by 3.
