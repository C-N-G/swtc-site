A [[malfunctioning]] [[player]] is deceived by the [[Narrator]], in accordance with the game's mechanics and rules, into believing their abilities (or abilities they think they have, such as if they are [[Confusion|confused]]) are functioning as normal, when in reality as long as they’re [[malfunctioning]] any informational abilities they have will yield arbitrary information, and any non-information abilities cannot alter the state of the game. The only exception to not altering the state of the game is that if a [[malfunctioning]] [[player]] uses their ‘once per game’ ability, or is malfunctioning during an ability that can only be activated once (such as on the first night), then it is used up, and they will not be able to use it again, even if they are no longer [[malfunctioning]].
While giving arbitrary information to [[malfunctioning]] [[Player|players]] can be used in part to balance the game, it should in most cases always be used in a deleterious manner to the [[malfunctioning]] [[player]] and their team.
A [[malfunctioning]] [[player]] can only corrupt the information received by their own abilities, not other [[player]] abilities that target them.

## Examples of [[Malfunctioning]]
- The [[Assistant]] learns that John is the [[Analyst]]. Later in the game, the [[Assistant]] dies, causing John to now be [[malfunctioning]]. John wakes in the night to receive information from his [[Analyst]] ability. The [[Narrator]] gives John arbitrary information because he is [[malfunctioning]].
