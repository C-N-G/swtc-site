## Ability
Any ability that targets you might not work, or might yield arbitrary information.

## Examples
- John is the Bodyguard. John chooses to protect the Mysterious player. John's ability does not work, and the Mysterious player dies that night.
- Jane is the the Psychologist. They choose the Mysterious player during the night. They incorrectly learn that the Mysterious player is Alert.
- The Mysterious player is malfunctioning. John is the Bodyguard. John chooses to protect the Mysterious player. The Mysterious player's ability does not work, and John dies that night.

## How to Play
- Depending on your role, the Narrator will usually use your ability to help protect you from danger, at least the start of the game. So, you can trust yourself to probably be safer than other players.
- Be wary of attracting unwanted suspicion from players whose abilities have yielded arbitrary information about you. In some cases, it might be in your best interest to be open with them about being Mysterious.

## How to Narrate
- If any ability targets the Mysterious player, determine if you believe it should work correctly or not.
