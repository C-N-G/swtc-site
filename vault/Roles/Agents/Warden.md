## Ability
Each night, you must choose a [[player]]: if you choose the [[Prisoner]], they become an [[Agent]] [[role]] of their choice.

## Setup Effects
If there is no [[Prisoner]], +1 [[Prisoner]].

## Examples
- John is the Prisoner. The Warden wakes up, chooses John, and then goes back to sleep. John wakes up and is informed that they were chosen by the Warden and must pick an Agent role to become.
- John is the Prisoner. The Warden wakes up, chooses Jane, and then goes back to sleep. Jane does not wake up as they are not the Prisoner.
- The Warden is malfunctioning. John is the Prisoner. The Warden wakes up, chooses John, and then goes back to sleep. John does not wake up as the Warden was malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- Adding the Prisoner to the game might seem bad for the Loyalist team, but knowing a Detrimental role that is definitely in play is information that you know is true, this can help you to understand the state of the game. If you manage to find them with your ability, then you'll also remove a Detrimental role from the game, thus helping the Loyalist team even more.

## How to Narrate
