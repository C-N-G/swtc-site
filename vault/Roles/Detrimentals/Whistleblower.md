## Ability
Each night, an Antagonist learns an Agent player and their role, until there are no more left to learn.

## Examples
- John is the Traitor. Jane is the Analyst. Because the Whistleblower is in the game, and alive, John learns that Jane is the Analyst.
- The Whistleblower is malfunctioning. Nothing happens because the Whistleblower is malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- As the Whistleblower, you might want to consider trying to die as soon as possible. However, if you get dismissed, it's a day wasted that could've been spent dismissing Subversive players.
- You should consider pretending to be a powerful Agent role to try and get the Subversive team to target you, thus wasting their abilities.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up an Antagonist player. Tell them an Agent player and their role. Send them back to sleep.
