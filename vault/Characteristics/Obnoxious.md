## Ability
Once per game, the first [[player]] (not yourself) to choose you with their ability during the night is [[malfunctioning]] until the day.

## Examples

- The Obnoxious player is malfunctioning. John is the Psychologist. John chooses the Obnoxious player. They correctly learn that the Obnoxious player is Obnoxious.

## How to Play
- If you are on the Loyalist team, try to bait the Antagonist into choosing you during the night. They will be unable to kill you as they will become malfunctioning until the day.
- If you are on the Subversive team, try to bait powerful Agent roles, especially one time use roles, into choosing you during the night. They will waste their abilities on you.

## How to Narrate
- If the Obnoxious player is chosen by another player with their ability, make that player malfunctioning until the day instead.
