## Ability
If you die, the [[Antagonist]] learns every [[player]]'s [[identity]] during the night.

## Examples
- The Archivist is dismissed, and dies. The following night, all Antagonists learn every player's identity.
- The Archivist dies during the night. All Antagonists learn every player's identity.
- The Archivist is malfunctioning. The Archivist is dismissed, and dies. The following night, nothing happens because the Archivist was malfunctioning when they died.

## How to Play
- As the Archivist, you should try to hide your role from other players! If the Antagonist finds out you’re the Archivist, they’re very likely to target you!

## How to Narrate
- If the Archivist dies, then during the night wake up each Antagonist in the game and tell them the identity of every player. Send the Antagonists back to sleep.
- If the Archivist died during the day, then wait until night to wake each Antagonist.
