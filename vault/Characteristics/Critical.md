## Ability
Once per game, during the night, you may choose a player: you learn if they have an ability that interacts with obsession.

## Examples
- John is the Shadow. The Critical player chooses John during the night, and learns that they do have an ability that interacts with obsession.
- Jane is the Analyst. The Critical player chooses Jane during the night, and learns that they do not have an ability that interacts with obsession.
- The Critical player is malfunctioning. John is the Shadow. The Critical player chooses John during the night, and incorrectly learns that they do not have an ability that interacts with obsession.

## How to Play
- It can be useful to save your ability until you have a player you strongly suspect of having an ability that interacts with obsession. This way you can confirm your suspicions.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Critical player. Ask them if they want to choose a player. Tell them if the player of their choice has an ability that interacts with obsession or not. Send them back to sleep.
