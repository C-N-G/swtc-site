## Ability

You start knowing an [Agent](/swtcpedia/agent) player (not yourself) and their [Role](/swtcpedia/role). If you die, they become [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## Examples

* The Assistant wakes up on the first night, and learns that John is the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst).
* The Assistant wakes up on the first night, and learns that John is the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst). Later in the game, the [Assistant](/swtcpedia/assistant) dies, causing John to now be [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). John wakes in the night to receive information from his [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst) ability The Narrator gives John arbitrary information because he is [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).
* The Assistant is [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). The Assistant wakes up on the first night. John is the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst), but the Assistant incorrectly learns that John is the [Bodyguard](/swtcpedia/bodyguard). Later in the game, the Assistant dies. John does not become [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning) because the Assistant is still [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## How to Play

* As the Assistant you know one player who, besides [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning) or appearing shenanigans, is confirmed to be an [Agent](/swtcpedia/agent). Telling as many players this as possible is a great way to let other [Loyalists](/swtcpedia/loyalist) know they can trust this player.
* Be wary about immediately trusting the player you learnt! You might have learnt false information somehow. If you tell them the [Role](/swtcpedia/role) you think they are before they tell you, then they can easily just lie to you by following your lead. If this happens, you won't know your information is false. Instead, tell them you're their Assistant, and that you'd like to know their [Role](/swtcpedia/role).
* While it can be very useful to share your information with other players, be careful because it might make you a target. If you die, the player that you learnt won't be able to trust their information as they'll be [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning) from now on.

## How to Narrate

* The first night that the Assistant is in play wake up the Assistant. Tell them a player who has an [Agent](/swtcpedia/agent) [Role](/swtcpedia/role), and their specific [Role](/swtcpedia/role). Send them back to sleep.
* If the Assistant dies mark the player that they learnt as [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## Additional Information

* If the Assistant is [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning) they can be told an incorrect player, or an incorrect [Role](/swtcpedia/role). If they cease to be [Malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning) they will not receive new information.
