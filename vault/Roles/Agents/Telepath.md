## Ability
Each night, you learn a [[role]]. One of your living neighbours is this [[role]].

## Examples
- The Telepath's living neighbours are the Analyst and the Assistant. The Telepath wakes up and learns Analyst.
- The Telepath's living neighbours are the Prisoner and the Assistant. The Telepath wakes up and learns Traitor, because the Prisoner appears as an Antagonist.
- The Telepath's living neighbours are the Analyst and the Assistant. The Telepath wakes up and learns Traitor. Neither of the Telepath's living neighbours are the Traitor.

## How to Play
- Your primary goal should be trying to work out which of your living neighbours has the role that you learnt.
- You could try telling your living neighbours the role you learnt, and seeing how they respond.
- If you want to learn information about other players, you could try getting your living neighbours killed so that your living neighbours change.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Telepath. Tell them a role which at least one of their living neighbours has. Send them back to sleep.
