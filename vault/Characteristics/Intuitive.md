## Ability
Each night, you learn who the [[Narrator]] thinks you should speak with the most.

## Examples
- John is the Analyst. On the first night, the Narrator tells the Intuitive player that they should speak with John.
- The Intuitive player is malfunctioning. Jane is the Traitor. On the first night, the Narrator tells the Intuitive player that they should speak with Jane.

## How to Play
- In most cases, the player the Narrator sends you to is likely to be on the same team as you, but be careful, there are reasons that a Narrator might want to point you in the direction of an opposing player instead.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Intuitive player. Tell them who you think they should speak with the most. Send them back to sleep.
