A [[player]] that appears as something, such as a team, [[role]], or [[rharacteristic]], will interact with the abilities and setup effects of other [[Player|players]] as if they were the thing that theyâ€™re appearing to be. For example, the [[Prisoner]] will [[Appearance|appear]] on the [[Subversive]] team and as an [[Antagonist]] [[role]] to [[Loyalist]] [[Player|players]].
A [[player]] who appears as something else does not actually mean they themselves are shown a different [[Role]] or [[Characteristic]] during setup.
If a [[player]] is appearing as dead due to their ability and becomes injured, or loses their ability some other way, then the [[narrator]] will announce that they are now alive at the first relevant opportunity, such as at the start of the day.
If a [[player]] who is alive but is appearing as dead is resurrected then they will still [[Appearance|appear]] as dead.
