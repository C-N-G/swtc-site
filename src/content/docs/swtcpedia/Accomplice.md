## Ability

You do not know you are the Accomplice. You think you are a different [Loyalist](/swtcpedia/loyalist) [Role](/swtcpedia/role), but you are not. The [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist) knows who you are.

## Setup Effects

You start on the [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team.
You think you are a [Loyalist](/swtcpedia/loyalist) [Role](/swtcpedia/role).
You neighbour the [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist).

## Examples

* On the first night that the Accomplice is in play they join the [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team. The [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist) learns who the Accomplice is. The Accomplice thinks they are the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst). The Narrator wakes the Accomplice up and treats them as if they are the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst) who is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).
* The Accomplice is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning) on the first night they are in play. The [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist) does not learn who the Accomplice is. The Accomplice thinks they are the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst). The Narrator wakes the Accomplice up and treats them as if they are the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst) who is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## How to Play

* Just because someone claims to be the [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist) and tells you that you're the Accomplice doesn't mean they're telling the truth!
* There are ways in which you might not have started neighbouring the [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist), such as is if one of your neighbours is a [Prisoner](/swtcpedia/prisoner).
* If you suspect that you're the Accomplice, then your number one priority should be trying to confirm your [Role](/swtcpedia/role). If the [Role](/swtcpedia/role) you think you are is consistently giving you information you know to be wrong, then perhaps you are the Accomplice.
* If you are certain that you're the Accomplice, then you should do everything possible to keep the [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist) safe. Try to divert attention onto yourself and away from them.

## How to Narrate

* Ensure that the Accomplice starts neighbouring an [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist).
* On the first night that the Accomplice is in play immediately change their team to [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive), and tell any [Antagonists](/swtcpedia/antagonist) who the Accomplice is. Treat the Accomplice as if they were the [Role](/swtcpedia/role) that they believe themselves to be and as if that [Role](/swtcpedia/role) was [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).
* You can provide the Accomplice with any arbitrary information that corresponds to the [Role](/swtcpedia/role) they believe they have. However, be cautious about game balance; their ability should primarily be [detrimental](/swtcpedia/detrimental) to the [Loyalist](/swtcpedia/loyalist) team.
