## Ability
On your first day, your role is announced to all players.

## Examples
- The Supervisor is in play from the start of the game. At the start of the first day, the Narrator announces who the Supervisor is.
- The Supervisor becomes in play later in the game. At the start of the next day, the Narrator announces who the Supervisor is.
- The Supervisor is malfunctioning. The Supervisor is in play from the start of the game. No announcement is made because the Supervisor is malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- As the Supervisor, you are uniquely powerful in that all players know your role. This means you're likely to die soon, as the Subversive team will want to kill a player who is confirmed to be on the Loyalist team.
- Your ability is very useful for confirming other players information, as you can be used as a control for them to test abilities against. Try to help other player's utilize their information and abilities to their full potential.
- Try not to get dismissed. If you're alive, then the Subversive team will be likely to waste a day targeting you.

## How to Narrate
- On the first day that the Supervisor is in play, announce at the start of that day that the Supervisor is in play.
