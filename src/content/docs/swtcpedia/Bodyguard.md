## Ability

Each night, after the first, you must choose a player (not yourself): if that player is killed that night you are killed instead.

## Examples

* The Bodyguard chooses to protect the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst). The [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst) is chosen during the night by the [Traitor](/swtcpedia/traitor). The Bodyguard dies instead of the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst).
* The Bodyguard is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). The Bodyguard chooses to protect the [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst). The [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst) is chosen during the night by the [Traitor](/swtcpedia/traitor). The [Analyst](/swtcpedia/analyst) dies.

## How to Play

* Try to find a player who has a useful ability to your team, and protect them every night. It's better that you die instead of them.
* Be careful about telling other players you are the Bodyguard. [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) players might try to target you to make sure they have control over who dies during the night, or they might lie to you and get you to protect them.

## How to Narrate

* Each night, wake up the Bodyguard. Tell them to choose a player. Send them back to sleep. If the player chosen by the Bodyguard is killed that night they are killed instead.
