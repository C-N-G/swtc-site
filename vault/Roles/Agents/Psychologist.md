## Ability
Each night, you must choose a [[player]]: you learn their [[characteristic]].

## Examples
- The Psychologist chooses John. John is Adaptable. The Psychologist learns that John is Adaptable.
- The Psychologist is malfunctioning. The Psychologist chooses John. John is Adaptable. The Psychologist learns that John is Persevering.

## How to Play
- As the Psychologist your ability will allow you to ascertain the characteristics of other players, this can be particularly helpful information if you can find players that have potentially high impact characteristics on the game, such as Trustworthy.
- You can use your ability to ascertain if people are lying about their characteristics. Try asking a player what their characteristic is, and then check them with your ability during the night. Remember, just because a player is lying, doesn't necessarily make them on the opposite team to you. They might have a good reason to lie.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Psychologist. Tell them to choose a player. Tell them the characteristic of the player they chose. Send them back to sleep.
