Secrets Within the Compound is a social deduction game for 6-16 [[Player|players]], and one [[narrator]]. One person assumes the [[Role]] of the [[narrator]], whilst the other [[Player|players]] receive a secret [[Role]] and a secret [[Characteristic]] at the start of the game, this determines what team theyâ€™re on and grants them powerful game altering abilities. The [[Player|players]] are divided into two teams, the [[Loyalist]] team, and the [[Subversive]] team.
The [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] must deduce, using a combination of logic and social skills, who the [[Subversive|Subversives]] are and eliminate them, whilst attempting to maintain the cohesion of the compound. The [[Loyalist]] team wins if there are no [[Subversive]] [[Player|players]] left alive.
The [[Subversive|Subversives]] must deceive their fellow [[Player|players]] and remain hidden whilst they eliminate the [[Loyalist|Loyalists]] or achieve their secret goals. The [[Subversive]] team wins if there is only 1, or less, [[Loyalist]] [[Player|players]] left alive, or if the compound cohesion reaches 0.
If the game results in a draw or stalemate then the [[Loyalist]] team win.
