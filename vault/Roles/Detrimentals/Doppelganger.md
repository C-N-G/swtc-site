## Ability
On your first night, you are told which player has the role you are confused as, and they are told you are their role.

## Setup
You are confused about being an in-play Agent.

## Examples
- John is the Analyst. The Doppelganger is confused that they are the Analyst, and is told that John is the Analyst. John is told that the Doppelganger player is the Analyst.
- The Doppelganger is malfunctioning. John is the Analyst. The Doppelganger is confused that they are the Assistant, and is incorrectly told that John is the Assistant. John is not told that the Doppelganger player is the Assistant, because the Doppelganger is malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- You and another player will know who each other are, but will start the game unable to tell which of you is real and which of you is the Doppelganger. Your first priority, whether you're really the Doppelganger or not, should be trying to work who is who! If you don't prioritize this, you'll end up helping the wrong team!
- Be careful about telling Loyalist players you think you might be the Doppelganger, because there is a 50/50 chance that you are on the Subversive team.
- If you are confused about having an information gathering ability, try to work out discrepancies in the information you receive to work out if you're the Doppelganger or not.

## How to Narrate
- On the first night that the Doppelganger is in play, wake up the Doppelganger. Tell them the player that has the in-play role they are confused as is the role they think they are. Send them back to sleep. Wake up the player that the Doppelganger learnt and tell them that the Doppelganger player is their role. Send them back to sleep.
