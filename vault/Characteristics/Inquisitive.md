## Ability
Once per game, during the night, you may choose to learn a role. One of your living neighbours is this role.

## Examples
- John is the Analyst. Jane is the Bodyguard. Both John and Jane are living neighbours of the Inquisitive player. On the first night, the Inquisitive player chooses to use their ability. They learn that one of their living neighbours is the Analyst.
- The Inquisitive player is malfunctioning. John is the Analyst. Jane is the Bodyguard. Both John and Jane are living neighbours of the Inquisitive player. On the first night, the Inquisitive player chooses to use their ability. They incorrectly learn that one of their living neighbours is the Traitor.

## How to Play
- Try to use your ability when you believe it would be most useful. If you have no other information to go on, that might be during the first night. If you have other information, it might be better to save your Inquisitive ability until later in the game.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Inquisitive player. Ask the Inquisitive player if they want to use their ability tonight. If they say yes, tell them a role belonging to one of their living neighbours. Send them back to sleep.
