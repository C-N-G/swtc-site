## Ability
Each night, after the first, if any players have died tonight, you learn who. Once per game, during the night, you may choose to resurrect a player that you learnt died that night. If you choose a player with this ability, you no longer have this ability.

## Examples
- John and Jane died in the night. The Medic wakes up and learns that John and Jane died tonight, and chooses to resurrect John, and thus loses their ability.
- John and Jane died in the night. The Medic wakes up and learns that John and Jane died tonight, and chooses to resurrect nobody, and thus keeps their ability.
- The Medic is malfunctioning. Nobody died in the night. The Medic wakes up and incorrectly learns that John and Jane died tonight, and chooses to resurrect John. John is not resurrected because he wasn't dead. The Medic loses their ability.
- The Medic is malfunctioning. John and Jane died in the night. The Medic wakes up and learns that John and Jane died tonight, and chooses to resurrect John. John is not resurrected because the Medic is malfunctioning. The Medic loses their ability.

## How to Play
- Try to save your ability to resurrect a player who you trust has a useful ability for your team!
- Be careful, the longer you wait to use your ability the greater your chance of dying before you get to use it!
- Keep your role secret! If the Subversive team learn you're the Medic they're likely to target you to stop you from saving a player.

## How to Narrate
- Once per game, during the night, if a player died tonight, wake up the Medic. Tell them who died tonight, and ask them if they want to resurrect one of those players. If applicable, resurrect the player the Medic chose. Send them back to sleep.
