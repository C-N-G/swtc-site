## Ability

Your neighbours cannot malfunction.

## Examples

* One of the Cook's neighbours chooses a player with the Obnoxious [characteristic](/swtcpedia/characteristic), they do not become [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning) because they neighbour the Cook.
* The Cook is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). One of the Cook's neighbours chooses a player with the Obnoxious [characteristic](/swtcpedia/characteristic), they become [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## How to Play

* Your ability is simple, but can be very useful for validating the information gained by your neighbours. Try to avoid ways in which you could become [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning), so as to always be of benefit to your neighbours.
* If you believe your neighbours aren't on your team, then it might be a good idea to get yourself dismissed so that you're no longer protecting your opponents.

## How to Narrate

* The first night that the Cook is in play mark their neighbours as immune to [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).
* If the Cook becomes [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning) remove the immunity from their neighbours.
