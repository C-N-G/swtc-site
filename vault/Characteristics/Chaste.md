## Ability
You can not change team.

## Examples
- John is the Necromancer. John chooses to convert the Chaste player to their team. The Chaste player does not change team.
- The Chaste player is malfunctioning. John is the Necromancer. John chooses to convert the Chaste player to their team. The Chaste player changes team.

## How to Play
- Try to convince players who can convert you to choose you, they won't know you haven't changed team, and circumstantially this could give you an edge over them.

## How to Narrate
- If the Chaste player would for any reason change team, they do not change team.
