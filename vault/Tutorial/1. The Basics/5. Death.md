Unlike many other social deduction games, in Secrets Within the Compound [[Player|players]] that have died are not eliminated from the game. Dead [[Player|players]] become ghosts, and can still win with their team. Dead [[Player|players]] are unable to nominate, vote, or use any of their abilities, unless otherwise specified. Dead [[Player|players]] are still allowed to talk with other [[Player|players]].
