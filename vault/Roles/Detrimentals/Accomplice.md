## Ability
You do not know you are the Accomplice. You think you are an [[Agent]] [[role]], but you are not. All [[Antagonist|Antagonists]] know who you are.

## Setup Effects
You neighbour an [[Antagonist]].

## Examples
- On the first night that the Accomplice is in play they join the [[Subversive]] team. The [[Antagonist]] learns who the Accomplice is. The Accomplice thinks they are the [[Analyst]]. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Accomplice up and treats them as if they are the [[Analyst]] who is [[Malfunctioning]].
- The Accomplice is [[Malfunctioning]] on the first night they are in play. The [[Antagonist]] does not learn who the Accomplice is. The Accomplice thinks they are the [[Analyst]]. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Accomplice up and treats them as if they are the [[Analyst]] who is [[Malfunctioning]].

## How to Play
- Just because someone claims to be the [[Antagonist]] and tells you that you're the Accomplice doesn't mean they're telling the truth!
- There are ways in which you might not have started neighbouring the [[Antagonist]], such as is if one of your neighbours is a [[Prisoner]].
- If you suspect that you're the Accomplice, then your number one priority should be trying to confirm your [[Role]]. If the [[Role]] you think you are is consistently giving you information you know to be wrong, then perhaps you are the Accomplice.
- If you are certain that you're the Accomplice, then you should do everything possible to keep the [[Antagonist]] safe. Try to divert attention onto yourself and away from them.

## How to Narrate
- Ensure that the Accomplice starts neighbouring an [[Antagonist]].
- On the first night that the Accomplice is in play immediately change their team to [[Subversive]], and tell any [[Antagonist|Antagonists]] who the Accomplice is. Treat the Accomplice as if they were the [[Role]] that they believe themselves to be and as if that [[Role]] was [[Malfunctioning]].
- You can provide the Accomplice with any arbitrary information that corresponds to the [[Role]] they believe they have. However, be cautious about game balance; their ability should primarily be [[Detrimental]] to the [[Loyalist]] team.
