## Ability
Each night, after the first, you learn if the player who most recently died from dismissal was Human.

## Examples
- John is the Analyst, and dies from dismissal. The Mortician wakes up and learns that John was Human.
- Jane is the Wraith, and dies from dismissal. The Mortician wakes up and learns that Jane was not Human.
- The Mortician is malfunctioning. John is the Analyst, and dies from dismissal. The Mortician wakes up and incorrectly learns that John was not Human.

## How to Play
- You should try to dismiss as many players as possible, even if you don't think they're an Antagonist, learning if someone is a Human is a helpful tool to work out what role they are.
- Try to keep your role a secret! The Subversive team will likely try to target you if they learn your role. The longer you can stay alive the more information you'll be able to get.

## How to Narrate
- If a player died from dismissal during the day, wake up the Mortician during the following night. Tell the Mortician if the player who most recently died was Human or not. Send them back to sleep.
