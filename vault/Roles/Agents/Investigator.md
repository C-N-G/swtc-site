## Ability
Each night, you must choose a [[player]] and an Agent [[role]]: you learn if they are this Agent [[role]].

## Examples
- The Investigator wakes up and chooses John and the Analyst. John is the Analyst. The Investigator learns that this is correct, John is the Analyst.
- The Investigator wakes up and chooses John and the Analyst. John is the Traitor. The Investigator learns that this is incorrect, John is not the Analyst.
- The Investigator is malfunctioning. The Investigator wakes up and chooses John and the Bodyguard. John is the Analyst. The Investigator incorrectly learns that John is the Analyst.

## How to Play
- As the Investigator your ability is very useful for testing the claims of other players. If a player tells you their role, you should check it that night to see if they're telling the truth.
- As your ability is very useful for destroying the bluffs of Subversive players, you will likely be a high priority target. You should keep your role a secret if possible, to increase the number of nights you have to learn information.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Investigator. Tell them to choose a player and an Agent role. Tell them if the player they chose is the role that they chose or not.
