## Ability
You do not know you are the Underachiever. You think you are an [[Agent]] [[role]], but you are not.

## Examples
- The Underachiever thinks they are the [[Analyst]]. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Underachiever up and treats them as if they are the [[Analyst]] who is [[Malfunctioning]].
- The Underachiever is [[Malfunctioning]]. There is no difference to their ability. The Underachiever thinks they are the [[Analyst]]. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Underachiever up and treats them as if they are the [[Analyst]] who is [[Malfunctioning]].

## How to Play
- If you suspect that you're the Underachiever, then your number one priority should be trying to confirm your [[Role]]. If the [[Role]] you think you are is consistently giving you information you know to be wrong, then perhaps you are the [[Accomplice]].

## How to Narrate
- Treat the Underachiever as if they were the [[Role]] that they believe themselves to be and as if that [[Role]] was [[Malfunctioning]].
- You can provide the Underachiever with any arbitrary information that corresponds to the [[Role]] they believe they have. However, be cautious about game balance; their ability should primarily be [[Detrimental]] to the [[Loyalist]] team.
