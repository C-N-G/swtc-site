Secrets Within the Compound has only four general rules, but it’s important to follow them to help maintain the integrity of the game and to make sure everyone has a good time.

1. This is a game of deceit. Unless otherwise specified, you may say whatever you want and pretend to use any abilities, even if they don’t belong to your [[role]] or [[characteristic]]. One major exception to this rule is that during the night phase, you may not discuss specific details of the current game with other [[Player|players]]. It is also very important to remember that some [[Player|players]] may be uncomfortable with lying or being lied to, and may have issues with being gaslighted, so it is the job of the [[Narrator]] to help ensure a healthy game environment where all people understand the principles of the game and can enjoy themselves without being bullied.
2. [[Player|Players]] are never eliminated from the game, even if their characters die. Dead [[Player|players]] may still talk and discuss with other [[Player|players]], but they can not vote or nominate other [[Player|players]] for [[dismissal]], unless otherwise specified.
3. No meta-gaming. No talking, texting, or messaging, with [[Player|players]] outside of any official or agreed upon forms of communication.
4. Do not interrupt the [[Narrator]], and make sure to listen to what they say. Ultimately, they have the final say in all rulings.
