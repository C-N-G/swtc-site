## Ability
On your first night, you learn how many of your neighbours woke up or will wake up that night due to their ability.

## Examples
- John is the Bodyguard. Jane is the Analyst. The Observant player learns that 1 of their neighbours woke up or will wake up that night.
- The Observant player is malfunctioning. John is the Bodyguard. Jane is the Analyst. The Observant player incorrectly learns that 2 of their neighbours woke up or will wake up that night. 

## How to Play
- Your ability will allow you to determine if any of your neighbours have abilities that act on the first night. One particularly useful bit of this information, is that most Antagonists do not act on the first night.

## How to Narrate
- On the first night, wake up the Observant player. Tell them how many of their neighbours woke up or will wake up that night due to their ability. Send them back to sleep.
