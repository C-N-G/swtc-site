A confused player sees themselves as being a different role or characteristic than their true role or characteristic. The Narrator will interact with the confused player as if they were the role or characteristic that they believe themselves to be. Any informational abilities the confused player believes they have will yield arbitrary information, and any non-information abilities cannot alter the state of the game.
While giving arbitrary information to confused [[Player|players]] can be used in part to balance the game, it should in most cases always be used in a deleterious manner to the confused [[player]] and their team.
A confused [[player]] only corrupts the information received by their own abilities, not other [[Player|players]] abilities that target them.

## Examples of Confusion
- The Underachiever is confused about being the [[Analyst]]. The [[Narrator]] wakes the Underachiever up and gives them arbitrary information.
