## Ability
Each night, you must choose a player (not yourself): your voting power is 0, but the player you chose the previous night gains 1 voting power.

## Examples
- The Intern chose John during the night. The following day Jane is nominated for dismissal. The Intern votes yes, their voting power is 0. John votes yes, their voting power is 2.
- The Intern is malfunctioning. The Intern chose John during the night. The following day Jane is nominated for dismissal. The Intern votes yes, their voting power is 1. John votes yes, their voting power is 1.
- If the Intern was malfunctioning during the night, but became non-malfunctioning during the day then their choice during the night has no impact on voting power. Likewise, if the Intern was not malfunctioning during the night, but becomes malfunctioning during the day then their choice at night has no impact on voting power.

## How to Play
- Try to pick players that you think you can trust during the night!
- If you don't know who to trust it could be advantageous for you to become malfunctioning, thus preventing your ability from working.

## How to Narrate
- Set the Intern's voting power to 0. Each night, wake up the Intern. Tell them to choose a player. Give the player they chose an additional 1 voting power. Send them back to sleep.
- Whilst the Intern is malfunctioning, ensure you give them their voting power back.
