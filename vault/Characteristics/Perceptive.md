## Ability
On your first night, you learn that 1 of 3 [[Player|players]] (not yourself) is a specific [[characteristic]].

## Examples
- John is Alert. On the first night, the Perceptive player learns that John, Jane, or Adam is Alert.
- The Perceptive player is malfunctioning. John is Alert. The Perceptive player incorrectly learns that Jane, Adam, or Eve is Alert.

## How to Play
- Try to get the players that you learnt to tell you what characteristic they are. If none of them tell you the characteristic that you learnt, then they might be lying or you might be malfunctioning.
- If you can tell a player what their characteristic is before they can tell you, then you can help to prove yourself as Perceptive to them.

## How to Narrate
- On the first night that the Perceptive characteristic is in play, wake up the Perceptive player. Tell them that 1 of 3 players, not themselves, is a specific characteristic. Send them back to sleep.
