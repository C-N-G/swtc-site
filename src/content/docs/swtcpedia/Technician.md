## Ability

When you die, 2 players on your team (not yourself) become [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## Examples

* The Technician is dismissed and dies. 2 players on their team (not them) immediately become [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).
* The Technician is [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning). The Technician dies during the night. Nobody becomes [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## How to Play

* Do not die! Don't let the [Subversive](/swtcpedia/subversive) team find out that you're the Technician, otherwise they might target you.
* If you're about to be dismissed and have no other defence, you might as well come out and tell everyone you're the Technician. It's better that the [Antagonist](/swtcpedia/antagonist) has to spend a night killing you instead of your team doing it for them through a dismissal.
* Try to become [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning), this will allow you to die without making other players [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).

## How to Narrate

* If the Technician dies, immediately mark 2 players on their team (not them) as [malfunctioning](/swtcpedia/malfunctioning).
