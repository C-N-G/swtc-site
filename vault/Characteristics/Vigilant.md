## Ability
Each night, you learn how many of your neighbours were chosen by other [[Player|players]].

## Examples
- John is the Psychologist. Jane neighbours the Vigilant player. During the night, John chose Jane. The Vigilant player learns that one of their neighbours was chosen during the night.
- The Vigilant player is malfunctioning.  John is the Psychologist. Jane neighbours the Vigilant player. During the night, John chose Jane. The Vigilant player incorrectly learns that none of their neighbours were chosen during the night.

## How to Play
- Using your information you can prove or disprove the claims of other players.
- If one of your neighbours dies during the night, but you learn that none of your neighbours were chosen. Then you know they might have killed themselves, or you could be malfunctioning.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Vigilant player. Tell them how many of their neighbours were chosen by other players. Send them back to sleep.
