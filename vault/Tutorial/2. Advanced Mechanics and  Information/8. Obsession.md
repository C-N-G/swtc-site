Obsession is when a player makes a genuine attempt to convince other players of something. Players are not compelled or forced to follow an obsession, but abilities that interact with obsession usually grant some positive or negative effect for following or not following an obsession.

## Examples of Obsession
- The Tulpa publicly announces that they believe themselves to be the Tulpa. The Tulpa is immediately dismissed, and dies. The day ends.
