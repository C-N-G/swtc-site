## Ability
Once per game, during the day, you may publicly make a statement. If this statement is true during the night, you die that night.

## Examples
- During the day, the Prophet claims that John is on the Subversive team. John is on the Subversive team. During the night, John is still on the Subversive team. The Prophet's statement is true, and so they die.
- During the day, the Prophet claims that Jane is on the Subversive team. Jane is on the Subversive team. During the night, Jane changes to the Loyalist team. The Prophet's statement is false, and so they do not die.
- The Prophet is malfunctioning. During the day, the Prophet claims that John is on the Subversive team. John is on the Subversive team. During the night, John is still on the Subversive team. The Prophet's statement is true, but they're malfunctioning, so they do not die.

## How to Play
- Once you make a statement it's very likely you will become a target for the Subversive team to kill, thus obfuscating the truthfulness of your statement. You should wait until you believe the Subversive team has a higher priority kill to increase the odds of them not killing you.
- Remember, you will only die during the night if the statement you made during the day is true at the time you would die, not at the time when you made the statement.

## How to Narrate
- If the Prophet makes a statement, and their statement is true during the night, then mark the Prophet as dead.
