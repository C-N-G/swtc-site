## Ability
Each night, after the first, if any players are dead, you learn who and may choose one: they learn they were chosen by the Necromancer and they join your team.

## Examples
- No one is dead. The Necromancer has no dead players to choose from. The Necromancer does not wake up.
- John is dead. The Necromancer wakes up and chooses John. John learns who the Necromancer is and joins their team.
- The Necromancer is malfunctioning. No one is dead. The Necromancer incorrectly learns that John is dead. The Necromancer wakes up and chooses John. Nothing happens because the Necromancer is malfunctioning.

## How to Play
- As the Necromancer, you are unable to directly kill players during the night. You should try to get players dismissed to convert them to your team.
- Try to prioritize converting players that are trusted the most by other players. Be mindful though, living players are unlikely to trust dead players if they believe a Necromancer is in the game.

## How to Narrate
- The first night that any players are dead, wake up the Necromancer and tell them who is dead. Ask them if they want to choose a dead player. Send them back to sleep. If their choice is not already on the Necromancer's team, change their team to be the same as the Necromancer. Wake up the Necromancer's choice and tell them who the Necromancer is, and if applicable, tell them their new team.
