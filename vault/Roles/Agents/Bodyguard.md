## Ability
Each night, after the first, you must choose a [[player]] (not yourself): if that [[player]] is killed that night you are killed instead.

## Examples
- The Bodyguard chooses to protect the [[Analyst]]. The [[Analyst]] is chosen during the night by the [[Traitor]]. The Bodyguard dies instead of the [[Analyst]].
- The Bodyguard is [[Malfunctioning]]. The Bodyguard chooses to protect the [[Analyst]]. The [[Analyst]] is chosen during the night by the [[Traitor]]. The [[Analyst]] dies.

## How to Play
- Try to find a [[player]] who has a useful ability to your team, and protect them every night. It's better that you die instead of them.
- Be careful about telling other [[Player|players]] you are the Bodyguard. [[Subversive]] [[Player|players]] might try to target you to make sure they have control over who dies during the night, or they might lie to you and get you to protect them.

## How to Narrate
- Each night, wake up the Bodyguard. Tell them to choose a [[player]]. Send them back to sleep. If the [[player]] chosen by the Bodyguard is killed that night they are killed instead.
