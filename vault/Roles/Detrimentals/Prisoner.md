## Ability
You [[Appearance|appear]] as a [[Subversive]] [[Antagonist]] to all [[Loyalist]] [[Player|players]], except the [[Warden]].

## Examples
- The [[Clairvoyant]] chooses the Prisoner. The Prisoner appears as [[Subversive]] to the [[Clairvoyant]]. The [[Clairvoyant]] incorrectly learns that their target is on the [[Subversive]] team.
- The Prisoner is [[Malfunctioning]]. The [[Clairvoyant]] chooses the Prisoner. The [[Clairvoyant]] correctly learns that their target is on the [[Loyalist]] team.

## How to Play
- You need to convince your team that you are the Prisoner, but be careful because the Prisoner is also a great bluff for [[Subversive]] [[Player|players]]!
- Try to become [[Malfunctioning]], this will allow [[Loyalist]] [[Player|players]] to learn your real team and [[Role]].

## How to Narrate
- The Prisoner counts as a [[Subversive]] [[Antagonist]] for all abilities and setup effects. If someone chooses the Prisoner with an ability, then treat the Prisoner as if they were actually a [[Subversive]] [[Antagonist]].
