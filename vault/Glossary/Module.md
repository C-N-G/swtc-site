Modules are collections of [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]] that are either thematically or mechanically similar, or just play well together. In Secrets Within the Compound [[Role|roles]] and [[Characteristic|characteristics]] from any module can be mixed and matched to create a custom [[Scenario]]. Or if you want, just play one of the official premade [[Scenario|scenarios]]!
