## Ability
Once per game, if you are dismissed as the result of a nomination, the player who nominated you is dismissed instead.

## Examples
- John nominates the Manipulative player. The Manipulative player is to be dismissed. John is dismissed instead at the end of the day.
- The Manipulative player is malfunctioning. John nominates the Manipulative player. The Manipulative player is dismissed.

## How to Play
- If you can attract suspicion and get other players to vote to dismiss you, you can manipulate this in your favour by baiting another player into nominating you and getting them dismissed instead.
- To hide your Manipulative characteristic, you should ensure that anyone who nominates you is also nominated that day, so players think the vote to dismiss them was successful.

## How to Narrate
- If the Manipulative player would be dismissed as a result of a nomination, ensure that the player who nominated them is dismissed instead.
